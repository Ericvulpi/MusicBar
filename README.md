#### Search for the track you are listening on :

#### And lastly ... the awesome black style :)

## About MusicBar

MusicBar is the first product from Tungsten...  
Ok, it's a joke. Special dedicace @ Ivan & Simon, 2 friends of mine who love to talk about launching a startup (we even found the name), but when it comes to actually doing something ... ;)

I actually started this project for 2 partly related reasons :
* I did a little bit of coding while learning aerospace engineering (so a while back), but when I got interested in neural networks (like everyone else in the world it seems) I had to rediscover the wonderful world of coding. The real estate on my old MacBook was ridiculous, especially to code, so I bought a new Mac. And that's when I discovered that my favorite menubar app was no longer supported : [you-control-tunes](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/15802/you-control-tunes). So I took it as challenge and decided I would rebuild my own version of it as an exercise.
* Also, as I mentioned above, a couple of friends and me were looking for the next big idea to launch a start up, and looking into how to build an app distributable through the Appstore sounded like a good idea, just to see what's involved.
