## About MusicBar

MusicBar is the first product from Tungsten...
Ok, it's a joke. Special dedicace @ Ivan & Simon, 2 fiends of mine who love to talk about launching a startup (we even found the name), but when it comes to actually doing something ... ;)

I actually started this project for a 2 partly related reasons :
* I did a little bit of coding while learning aerospace engineering (so a while back), but when I got interested in neural networks (like everyone else in the world it seems) I had to rediscover the wonderfull world of coding. The real estate on my old macbook was ridiculous, especially to code, so I bought a new Mac. And that's when I discovered that my favorite menubar app was no longer suported [you-control-tunes](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/15802/you-control-tunes) I took it as challenge and thought I would rebuild my own version of it as an exercise
* Also, as I mentionned above, a couple of friends and me were looking for the next big idea to launch a start up, and looking into how to build an app distributable through the appstore sounded like a good idea, just to see what's involved
